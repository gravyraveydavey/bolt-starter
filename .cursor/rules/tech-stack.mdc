# Project File Structure:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── layout/
│   │   ├── sidebar
│   │   ├── header
│   └── └── footer
├── app/
├── app/auth/
├── app/api/
├── hooks/
├── public/
├── styles/
└── lib/
```
all pages are nested under the ./src/app folder
all auth related pages and routes should be nested under the ./src/app/auth folder
all non auth related api endpoints are in the ./src/app/api folder
all components must be nested under the ./src/components folder
component files must be named using kebab case like example-component.tsx and be nested under the ./src/components folder unless otherwise specified
complex components should be broken into smaller components and placed within their own folder within ./src/components
